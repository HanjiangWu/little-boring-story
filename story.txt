 Once upon a time, there's a family live on a normal life in a mountainous village. The family

 has three members,with dad, mom and a boy with 12 years old. Dad is named Chris,and mom is 

 called Liz and the boy is called George. Suddenly, one day, when Chris is working in a cave

 in the nearest mountain of their village as normal, he finds something irregular that there is

 a yellow light glowing at the end of the cave. He steps forward and see a secret entry. Driven by

 the curiosity, he snares at the entry and was shocked. He runs as fast as possible to go back and 

 tell this secret entry his child and wife.
